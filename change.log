v1.4
- Added the ability for units to displace eachother if they have the canDisplace property. This fixes issues with cats blocking hallways, but also lets things move past bats since it didn't make sense for bats to physically block people's path.
- Reworded the combat text.
- Fixed a bug where the disintegrating potion could disintegrate the player's fist.
- Added a smooth transition between the title screen and the game.
- Added title screen music (waiting on original music from jazz)
- Increased the player's starting health from 25 to 30. This should help reduce the incidents of getting instakilled by the higher level monsters when the player felt they had plenty of health.
- On smaller displays, the game will now sacrifice layout to try and better fit the available screen space.
- Poison potions are no longer lethal unless the player is already at extremely low health. 
- Added slight healing effect to agility and defence potions to make them a little more useful.

v1.5
- Having a boss stage on the map is no longer required. This enables map creators to opt for a map with no boss.
- Weapon enchantments and curses! Enchantments and curses can now be identified like potions, but you're probably not likely to run into two of the same thing.
- Many wordings have been updated.
- The Potion of Identification can now identify weapons, and it's chance to identify multiple items has been increased.
- Level Up Potion has been added, increases all player stats permanently and does not need to be identified. Only appears in the treasure drop table.
- Monsters now have a chance to drop items from the treasure drop table. (Needed because weapons are now expendable via enchantments)
- Moved the Bat weapon out of the treasure drop table since it's a pretty bad weapon. This means that monsters have a fair chance of dropping it.
- Added brass knuckles to acompany the Bat weapon in the standard drop table.
- Updated css to include a few nice animations (also adds a proper animation for fadeout when the game starts)
- Added title music, again by jazz cat!

v1.6 
- Unlocked doors are now displayed with a '/' character to differentiate them from locked doors which retain the '+' character.
- Added color coding to a number of messages in the log. I'm not totally decided on a specific key for the color coding, I'll need a bit of input on this.
- The game now collects some stats while you play that display at the end of the game or when you die.
- Attempted to optimize the html for a better experience loading the game.
- Movement no longer hinders stamina recovery quite as much.
- Added some error checking to map loading which can help map creators pinpoint errors in their maps.
- Added Endurance and Bloodlust enchantments.
- Cursed bats and brass knuckles can no longer get the 'dullness' curse, this was a bit too mean since that made them just as weak and fighting bare-handed.

v1.7
- Combat update. Many weapons and monsters have had their values moved around to balance them around these changes. Includes the introduction of a strength stat on characters which influences base damage as well as stamina loss. Heavy weapons can no longer be held by characters with a strength stat that is too low to attack with them.
- Added exp and levelling. This paves the way to a system where the player can pick and choose stats to level up, but for the moment just adds a little bit into everything each level.
- Added poison mechanic, player takes damage equal to poison level every five turns, and the poison level deincrements at the same interval. This makes poison extremely problematic in large amounts, but not a big deal if in small portions.
- Added Poisonous Spider low-level monster, Kobold medium-level monster, and Massive Cobra high-level monster.
- Added various new potions relevant to this update. Exp potion, Potion of Forgetting, and Antipoison potion (The antipoison does not need to be identified).
- Added new flail weapon.

v1.7.1
- Main menu now displays 'Loading...' again after switching the map until the map has finished loading.
- Tweaked around a lot of character values, continuing balance from the last update.
- New favicon.
- Assorted bug fixes, and new bugs!

v1.8.0
- Fixed some inconsistencies with how defence and agility potions work.
- Other bug fixes.
- Identified items will now show a description relevant to that identified item. 
- Reduced the size of the font used by the game about 83%, inital loading time is much lower now.
- New hazard class enables the creation of hazards on map tiles. So far all this does for the game is change how the displacer beast's tail smash attack works- the ceiling tiles don't fall during the same turn. Instead, the falling rocks show up as hazards for the next turn, which gives the player exactly one turn to get out of the way. As a consequence to this, the falling rocks now have much greater consequences if you are hit by them. Hazards are also one of a few pieces of groundwork needed for adding wands and the eventual Dragon boss.
- Updated AI to avoid hazards.
- Potion of forgetting now un-identifies itself as well as another random item, which makes it much more evil.

v1.9.0
- New options menu that allows configuration of keybinds, and a setting to enable/disable sound. These settings persist between refreshes as long as your browser keeps the game's cookie data.
- The game log has been inverted so that new text shows up at the top of the log. In theory this is easier to read while you are watching the map screen.
- The game log also has a fake scrolling effect now.
- Fixed the message log and inventory sometimes scrolling from keyboard input.
- Fixed potion of identification identifying itself and not identifying weapons.
- A few other bug fixes.

v2.0.0
- Magical wands have been added! Have fun burning your enemies to a crisp with your trusty wand of fireball!
- Added a few enhanced versions of standard potions.
- Added a number of enhanced weapons.
- Item rarity system overhaul, there are now four tiers of item rarity. Common (potions, very weak weapons, junk), Uncommon (standard weapons, enhanced potions, basic wands), Rare (stronger weapons, standard wands, level up potion), and Ultra Rare (very powerful weapons and wands).
- Easter eggs?
- Added spear trap hazard (currently unimplemented)
- The game cookie is now handled a bit better.

v2.1.0
- Fixed a bug with the boss room door.
- Spear traps have been implemented on the normal and hard difficulty maps. (credit ToasterBiome aka: baiomu)
- Some work has been done regarding the implementation of altars, but is not accessible yet. (credit ToasterBiome aka: baiomu)
- You no longer can gain exp for killing yourself. (As hilarious and obscure this interaction was, it defeated the point of some 'dangerous' actions since you would often level up from the exp you gained from killing yourself, which would then often heal you above the threshold for dying)
- You now have to hover the mouse over inventory items to see their action buttons. This makes the inventory interface much cleaner and addresses some issues with buttons and text overflowing off inventory entries. (credit Zeustal for tick graphic)
- The inventory is now sorted, and junk items now "stack" so that duplicates of them do not take up so much space.
- Item dropping is now enabled for all stages of the game. I personally recommend not dropping anything, but I guess you can now if you really want to.
- Statuses such as poison, stun, exhaustion, loss of control, and certain enchantment information are now displayed underneath the other stat counters. (credit Zeustal for all status graphics)
- Attacking monsters from a distance should now cause them to aggro properly.
- Increased the size of the boss room in The Dungeon on easy and normal to make things just slightly less claustrophobic.
- The Displacer Beast shouldn't get stuck behind hazards anymore.
- Restored feature where potions only take half a turn to use, making them more viable to use during combat.

v2.1.1
- Further improvements to inventory sorting.
- Added a status icon for damage reduction. (credit Zeustal for graphics)
- Added scrolls which work a lot like potions but are a seperate category of items and take a full turn to use (unlike potions which use your quick action which won't end your turn). Scrolls have the same rarity level as normal potions (But since there are more potion varieties you'll still encounter potions more often). Adds Scroll of Identify, Scroll of Recharge, and Scroll of Cleansing; with more to come soon.
- Scroll of Identify has replaced Potion of Identification. The code for the identify effect has been updated to choose identifiable items at random from the inventory (as was always intended but I was lazy and never got around to fixing it until now), and now will consistently identify a number of items somewhat proportionate to the number of items available ceil(log(eligibleItemsTotal) + 0.25).
- Fixed a bug where monsters would stand in place forever after losing their target.

v2.1.2
- Removed brass knuckles because there were too many low-level weapon drops.
- Scroll of Disintegrate Weapon has replaced Potion of Disintegration. It just makes more sense this way.
- Improved AI movement code. Still no actual pathfinding, but monsters should get stuck behind things less easily now. This also makes their movement a bit less predictable. (Known bug: In some cases when a monster can't get to you they may seem to 'pace' back and forth as opposed to standing still like they used to. This can't really be fixed until I implement actual pathfinding.)
- The Massive Cobra monster now uses the "Ꭶ" character instead of "Z". (It looks better in-game I promise)
- Lots of minor tweaks and bug fixes.

v2.1.3
- Did some optimizations to the message log, it turned out that making more than one or two messages at once caused far more lag than it should have. Fixed for the most part now.
- Added Potion of Camouflage. It basically just greatly reduces the effectiveness of enemy perception stats, it's not useful for disengaging when already in combat since most monsters will still be able to detect you from a one tile distance.
- Decreased the average starting charge level for weapon enchantments. Enchanted weapons now start with 10 - 30 charges (used to be 10 - 40) and cursed weapons start with 8 - 20 charges (also used to be 10 - 40).
- Made unenchanted weapons much more rare.

v2.1.4
- Key repeat is now enabled, with a cap of 5 inputs per second when key-repeating. The input cap makes the input more consistent across devices, and helps people not accidentally kill themselves as easily.
- Added Cutpurse enemy.
- Added Wand of Reverse Entropy.
- Fixed display priority on hazards and projectiles.
- Added tree, bush, rock, water, and path tile types for additional map flavor potential.
- Cats now Ñ

v2.2.0
- Brand new vision system. You no longer can see things behind walls and such, but you can still see the map layout for areas you have travelled through. (You should really try the z'ralnixeus map now, it's so much better with this)
- Fixed some language errors. 
- A number of balance changes since the game is now harder with the vision system implemented. Many monsters have been debuffed and the player starts with slightly more health now. Health and stamina restoration upon levelling up increased from 20% to 25%.
- Buffed bloodlust enchantment. Each stack of bloodlust now increases weapon damage by 30% (up from 10%) and instead of losing all stacks of bloodlust after 8 turns of no kills, you only lose half of the stacks (rounded up) and the no kills countdown restarts.

v2.2.1
- Added a number of aesthetic tiles for use in making more lively looking maps.

v2.2.2
- Internally reorganized files so the repository isn't such a mess.
- Fixed some english issues.
